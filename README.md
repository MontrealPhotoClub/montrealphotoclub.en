As the club was growing, it was time to bid farewell to our MVP on [carrd.co](https://carrd.co) and refactor the whole thing. It helped that [Narative](https://narative.co) released their Gatsby theme **Novela** at the same time.

This website is built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), themed with a customized version of [Novela](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela), and deploys on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
