** Free workshop in French - Limited spots **

For this new year, the Montréal Photo Club once again teams up with François Desrosiers, Technical Sales Executive chez Olympus Canada to offer you a free workshop on portrait photography with a flash.
The workshop will be held from 6 to 8PM at Royal Photo.

"One of the best way to improve your photos quality is to control your lighting. No need for a super professional equipment; only 1 to 2 flashes, some accessories and *voilà!*

The Olympus system is particularly easy to use to get the results you'd like.

Take some unique portraits of your loved ones for Valentine's Day"

We are honoured to have François Desrosiers as presenter for this event. François works since 1987 in photography including almost 30 at Lozeau as Director of Workshops, Speaker, and Instructor. He's still offering his formations alongside his activities at Olympus.
He has done over 20 solo exhibitions and multiple books. He's a passionate self-taught always looking for new photographic experimentations.

The workshop is free and open to all. In order to guarantee its quality, we have to limit the spots available and invite you to confirm your participation.

The Montréal Photo Club is a friendly photo club gathering photographers from all skills and horizons.
