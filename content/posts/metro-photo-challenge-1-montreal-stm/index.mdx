After the photowalks with Unsplash and based on feedback receive from previous events, we decided to host our next event in a different way.

The concept was easy. We'd meet at Berri-UQÀM métro station and from there people would be assigned random groups and métro stations. The goal was to get everybody in smaller groups as to not get intimidated; and to get them out of their comfort zone.

We also feel that a constraint (_here in the form of a theme and limited locations_) is an excellent way to spark creativity and approach photography differently than what you'd usually do.

Even before the event happened, it was already a popular success with hundreds of people registering an interest on the Facebook event [The Metro Photo Challenge - Montréal](https://www.facebook.com/events/2447411852009601). Which led to our founder [Jp Valery](/authors/jpvalery) to be interviewed on [CBC-Radio Canada](https://cbc.ca).

When the day came, dozens of people answered the call and came to explore and experience the Montréal subway system in a different way.

A lot of beautiful pictures were crafted that day as well as new friendships.
