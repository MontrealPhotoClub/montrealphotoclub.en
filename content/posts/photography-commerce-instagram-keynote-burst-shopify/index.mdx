## How has Instagram impacted the relationship between Photography and Commerce? Come hear 2 experts on the topic followed by a meet and greet

Over the months we heard a lot of questions surrounding Instagram. We were also eager to host a more educational event. And last but not least we wanted to kickstart a project with our friends over at [Burst](https://burst.shopify.com)

>Burst is a free stock photo platform that is powered by Shopify [...] constantly uploading new photos and adding new categories to reflect current trends in ecommerce and retail.

We were humbled to have the support of Burst and Shopify Montr√©al for this event. And even more humbled to have two amazing speakers on stage that night.
